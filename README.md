# 240a-paralle-programming
project for 240a

The basic idea is to implement one search engine for Wikipedia data set. The key algorithm for the search engine implementation would be page rank. The final goal for this project is that when a user input a key word or a series of key words, the search engine could return all the related Wikipedia pages, in a sorted list reflecting the correlation with input key word(s). Different from the existing search engine implementation, we use Spark framework to support the storage and computation of our search engine. Hopefully, with RDD in Spark, the search engine would be more efficient than those on Hadoop or other computing frameworks. In addition, there is a layer on top of Spark named GraphX, which is aimed to speed up the graph processing. If possible, we could work on it to further improve performance of our search engine.
